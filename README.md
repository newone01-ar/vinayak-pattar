## 🔬 About Me

I'm passionate about semiconductor innovation and love building analog, mixed-signal, RF, and power IC designs that balance performance, area, and efficiency. I enjoy solving problems at the transistor level, exploring circuit topologies, and using simulation tools to validate and optimize designs.

I’m currently working on building a solid portfolio of fundamental and advanced analog/mixed-signal blocks while preparing for industry roles in circuit design and application engineering.
